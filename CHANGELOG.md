# Changelog

Version format: `MAJOR.MINOR` (MINOR is always 2 digits, e.g. `1.01`).

Every push gets one entry here. MINOR increases by however many distinct
items (features/fixes) that push contains — a push with 1 item goes up by
1 (e.g. `1.01` → `1.02`); a push with 3 items goes up by 3 (e.g. `1.02` →
`1.05`). If MINOR would pass `.99`, MAJOR increments and MINOR carries the
remainder (e.g. `1.99` + 2 items → `2.01`).

## v1.06 — 2026-09-22

- Documented the changelog/versioning process and the "always confirm before
  push" rule directly in `CLAUDE.md`, so it applies to any collaborator's
  Claude Code session in this repo, not just this one.
- The Events by Category list now shows a Gathering's Series — Sermon Title
  as a second line under its name, matching the calendar cards, so a zone
  leader can scan what each Gathering is about without opening it.

## v1.04 — 2026-09-22

- The month grid and the Events by Category list below it no longer show
  events that fall on the leading/trailing overflow days from the previous
  or next month — only events actually within the viewed month are shown,
  keeping those muted overflow days visually clean. Holidays, season bars,
  and multi-day event bars are unaffected.

## v1.03 — 2026-09-22

- Gathering event cards (month grid, day view) now show the Series and
  Sermon Title as a second line, in the same style as the time, when
  either is set — e.g. "Faith Series — We need to have faith!"
- Reordered the Gathering add/edit form: Gathering Type and the fields that
  feed the title (Series, Preacher Name, etc.) now come before Name, and
  Name sits immediately before Date/Time. The Name field now notes it's
  auto-filled and only needs editing if necessary.
- Added a live Preview panel at the bottom of the Add/Edit Event form
  (before Save) showing exactly what will be saved — title (with the Y/P/U/A
  prefix for Events or the Gathering title for Gatherings), the Series —
  Sermon Title line where applicable, and the time range.

## v1.00 — 2026-09-22

Baseline — existing app as of this point. Detailed history before this
version lives in `git log`, not here; versioned entries start with the next
push.
